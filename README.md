# graphql-builder

## *** IMPORTANT: This is a Fork to allow the library to work with React Native/Reagent 0.8 ***

This library removes the dependency on cuerdas so no camel/kebab/pascal transformation is done. 
See issue: https://github.com/retro/graphql-builder/issues/4

Original library is found here: https://github.com/retro/graphql-builder

GraphQL client library for Clojure and ClojureScript.
