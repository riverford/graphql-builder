# graphql-builder

## *** IMPORTANT: This is a fork to allow the library to work with React Native/Reagent 0.8 ***

This library removes the dependency on cuerdas so no camel/kebab/pascal transformation is done.

See issue: https://github.com/retro/graphql-builder/issues/4

The original library and documentation is found here: https://github.com/retro/graphql-builder
